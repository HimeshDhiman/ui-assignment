# React UI Assignment — InputField & DataTable

**Author:** <Himesh Kumar Sharma>  
**Repo:** https://github.com/HimeshDhiman/ui-assignment.git/<repo-name>

## Project overview
This small project demonstrates two reusable UI components built with **React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS** and documented in **Storybook**:

- **InputField** — flexible text input with label, helper text, error states, variants, sizes, clear & password toggle.
- **DataTable** — table with sortable columns, row selection, loading & empty states.

This repository contains:
- A demo app (`npm run dev`) showing the form + table.
- Storybook stories for both components (`npm run storybook`) documenting usage and states.

## Tech stack
- React + TypeScript (Vite)
- TailwindCSS v4
- Storybook (for component docs)
- Optional: Chromatic / Vercel for Storybook deployment
